## Compliance and Security Frameworks

#### Compliance Frameworks

- These define what needs to be done to meet legal, regulatory or industry standards

Provide us the guidelines and standards to protect 
  - personal info
  - health records
  - payment details

- `GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)` - 
  - Purpose: Protects personal data of EU citizens, emphasizing privacy rights and data governance
  - Tools: OneTrust, TrustArc
- `HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) - in US, Protected Health Information (PHI)`
  - Purpose: Focuses on safeguarding patient health information (PHI) through strict data access and access controls
  - Tools: Compliance Group or Paubox
- `PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)`
  - Purpose: Ensures the protection of cardholder data by setting security standards for payments systems
  - Tools: Prisma Cloud (formerly Twistlock)
- `NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)`
  - Purpose: Provides risk-based guidelines and controls to secure information systems, reduce threats like cyberattacks or natural disasters and protect privacy
  - Tools: NIST SRE Toolkit
- `CIS Benchmarks (Center fo Internet Security)`
  - Purpose: Helps set secure baselines for systems by providing detailed configuration standards, making it easier to avoid vulnerabilities
  - Tools: `kube-bench`

#### Threat Modeling Frameworks

- Define how to do it by identifying specific threats and suggesting `mitigations` to secure the system
- Two frameworks: `Stride` (Microsoft) and `Mitre Attack`

- `Stride` - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-threats#stride-model 
  - `Spoofing`
    - Attacker impersonate a user, can be mitigated by implementing strong authentication
  - `Tampering`
    - Alter data (in transit or in rest), can be mitigated with encryption and digital signatures 
  - `Repudiation`
    - Claiming that you didn't do something (can be honest or false), can be mitigated with audit logs
  - `Information Disclosure`
    - Sensitive data could be exposed in a MySQL for example
  - `Denial of Service` 
    - Avoid with rate limiting and resource quota
  - `Elevation of Privilege`
    - Avoided with RBAC policies to declare what each user can do  

- `Mitre Attack` - https://attack.mitre.org/ - documents `Tactics` and documents `Mitigations`

- `Threat Matrix for Kubernetes (from Microsoft)`: https://microsoft.github.io/Threat-Matrix-for-Kubernetes/ (inspired from `Mitre Attack`)

#### Supply Chain Compliance

- The previous two frameworks (Compliance and Thread Modeling) were focusing on Internal components
- `Supply Chain Compliance` frameworks focus on all the external components (APIs, Libraries, Images, etc)

- Map of Kubernetes supply chain security (Jim Bugwardia, founder of Kyverno) https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/04/12/a-map-for-kubernetes-supply-chain-security/
  - `Artifacts` 
     - verifying what you deploy
     - `cosign` utility from sigstore https://github.com/sigstore/cosign
     - Verify Signed Kubernetes Artifacts: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/
  - `Metadata` -
    - What is an SBOM: https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/what-is-an-sbom-sbom-explained-in-5-minutes
    - `SBOM` (Software Bill Of Materials) a nested description of software artifact components and metadata.
    - `syft` can be generated to generate an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
    - Verify SBOM: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/#verify-the-software-bill-of-materials
  - `Attestations`
    - Verify Metadata 
  - `Policies`
    - How do we make sure we deploy verified trustworthy artifacts? Policies come in.  
    - Policies are the rules that ensure `compliance` and `security standards` are enforced automatically
    - They help prevent insecure or non-compliant components from being deployed
    - sigstore's `Kubernetes Policy Controller`can integrate with Kubernetes Admission Controller to enforce these rules at deploy time: https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/

How these work together:
- `Artifacts`: - the binaries and container images are signed using `cosign`
- `Metadata`: - the SBOM details all the components and their origins, helping you identify risks 
- `Attestations`: - the SBOM and other metadata are signed to ensure trustworthiness
- `Policies`: - finally Admission Controllers verify these signatures and enforce compliance before deployment

- in-toto: (https://in-toto.io/) - A framework to secure the integrity of software supply chains
- sigstore (https://docs.sigstore.dev/) - An open source project for improving software supply chain security
- Chef InSpec (https://docs.chef.io/inspec/) and OpenSCAP (https://www.open-scap.org/) - automate compliance checks and generate audit reports

#### Application and Tooling

- `Shift-Left` approach - using security tools early to catch security issues early in development phase
