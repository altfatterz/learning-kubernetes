## Cloud Native Security

#### The 4 C's of Cloud Native Security

- Cloud (Datacenter / Network / Servers)
- Cluster (Authentication / Authorization / Admission / Network Policy)
- Container (Restrict Images / Supply Chain / Sandboxing / Privileged )
- Code (Code security best practices)

#### Cloud Provider Security

- Threat Detection
  - Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM / SOAR solution)
    - SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) - essential component of effective cybersecurity
    - SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response - not just detect security threats but also deal with them
  - AWS - GuardDuty - 
  - GCP - Security Command Center
- Application Firewalls (WAF)
  - Azure WAF (protection against SQL injection, XSS atack)
  - AWS WAF (Load Balancer , AWS CloudFront)
  - Google Cloud Armor (DDoS Attack)
- Container Security
  - AKS - uses OS Bottlerocket, uses kube-bench, 
  - EKS 
  - GKS - Open Policy Agent

- Shared Responsibility Model

### Infrastructure Security

1. Isolate critical applications on separate servers for better security
2. Restrict Docker port (2375) access with firewall rules and policies
3. Apply least privilege to containers and secure Kubernetes Dashboard
4. Store sensitive data securely using Kubernetes Secrets and RBAC
5. Encrypt etcd data and use TLS authentication for protection

- Using a privileged container the attacker can use a know vulnerability (dirty cow) to escalate its privileges

#### Kubernetes Isolation Techniques

1. Use namespaces to isolate application components securely
2. Implement network policies to control inter-component communication
3. Apply RBAC to restrict access and prevent unauthorized access
4. Set resource quotas to prevent resource monopolization
5. Use security contexts to run containers are non-root users

#### Artifact Repository and Image Security

- [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) / [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair) - scan container images (including the base image)
- [JFrog Artifact Repository](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) - storing build artifacts
- [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages)
- JFrog Artifactory great feature to check stored images for any security weakness by integrating with security scanning tools
- Enhancing Image Security with Digital Signatures - images have no changes

#### Workload and Application Security

- [SQL Injection](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp) Attacks
- [SonarQuabe](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/)
- [OWASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OWASP)
- [Datadog Application Security Monitoring (ASM)](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/application-security-management/)
- [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com/)
